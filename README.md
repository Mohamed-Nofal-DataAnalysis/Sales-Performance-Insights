# Sales-Performance-Insights-Dashboard-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales data using a structured data model in Excel,  
and to build interactive dashboards that provide clear insights into sales performance across locations, products, and customers.  
This helps decision-makers identify trends, evaluate profitability, and optimize business strategies.

- Data Modeling: Built a structured data model in Excel with relationships between tables.  
- Data Analysis: Used PivotTables, measures, and calculated fields to summarize data.  
- Dashboard Creation: Designed interactive dashboards (Location, Product, Customer) with charts and slicers.  
- Insights: Extracted key findings to support data-driven decision-making.
