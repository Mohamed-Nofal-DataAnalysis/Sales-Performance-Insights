# Sales-Performance-Insights-Dashboard-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales data using a structured data model in Excel,  
and to build interactive dashboards that provide clear insights into sales performance across locations, products, and customers.  
This helps decision-makers identify trends, evaluate profitability, and optimize business strategies.

## Dataset used
[Download Dataset](https://github.com/Mohamed-Nofal-DataAnalysis/Sales-Performance-Insights/tree/main/Dataset)

## Questions (KPIs)

- What is the total sales, profit, and discount across different regions?  
- Which products and categories generate the highest profit?  
- Who are the top-performing customers by sales and orders?  
- How do different customer segments contribute to overall performance?  
- What are the most common shipping modes and their impact on delivery?  
- Which locations (states/regions) contribute the most to revenue?

## Process
- Data Collection: Gathered raw sales data (Orders, Customers, Products, Locations).  
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.  
- Data Modeling: Built a structured data model in Excel with relationships between tables.  
- Data Analysis: Used PivotTables, measures, and calculated fields to summarize data.  
- Dashboard Creation: Designed interactive dashboards (Location, Product, Customer) with charts and slicers.  
- Insights: Extracted key findings to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Insight
- Sales performance varies significantly across regions, with some states contributing the majority of revenue.  
- Certain product categories and sub-categories generate high sales but low profit due to discounts.  
- A small group of customers represents the largest share of total sales.  
- Customer segments show different purchasing behaviors, with corporate clients contributing the highest profit margin.  
- Standard shipping is the most frequently used mode, but express shipping offers better delivery performance.  

## Final Conclusion :
- This project demonstrates how sales data can be transformed into actionable insights using Excel dashboards and a structured data model.  
- The analysis highlights key trends in locations, products, and customers, helping businesses identify strengths and areas for improvement.  
- By leveraging these dashboards, decision-makers can optimize strategies to increase profitability, improve customer targeting, and enhance operational efficiency.
